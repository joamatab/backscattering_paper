We thank the reviewers, the editor and the journal staff for taking the time to review the manuscript and for their feedback. They have pointed out several constructive comments which have contributed to the improvement of the paper. Below we address each comment individually together with the changes made to the manuscript accordingly. We believe that all the suggestions have been adequately addressed and we hope that this version will be accepted for publication in Optics Express.


Reviewer 1:

1. We appreciate the praises on the paper.
2. We defined E_c in the caption for Figure 1.
3. As suggested by the reviewer, we added a reference to the group index in equation 6 and changed the description to “average” group index.
4. We clarified that v and v0 refer to optical frequencies just before equation 
5. We discussed that this model can easily be extended to CROWs by making the output coupler frequency dependent and added the reference proposed by the reviewer.  We also pointed out that the time-domain responses can be obtained by taking a Fourier Transform of the frequency-domain results.  These additions are included at the end of section 5. 
6. We clarified (in the first paragraph of section 5) that the multiple scatterers can be modeled as a single backscatterer since the coherence length due the spectrum of the cavity lineshape should be much longer than the physical cavity length so all the different scatterers will sum up to a single value.
7. We clarified the descriptions for the under and over-coupled regimes in the text just after equation 25.
8. We reworded the sentence "for analysis simplicity" 
9. We corrected the typographic error in the acknowledgements.
