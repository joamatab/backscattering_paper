# Reviewer Comments

## Reviewer 1:

The authors make a useful study of backscattering in ring resonators. Some corrections are needed before the manuscript can be published.

The authors need to be more rigorous in their definition of terms. In many cases a term is being used before it has explained. e.g. E_c appears in figure 1 and is defined on page 4

The appearance of the group index in equation 6 is non-trivial. This should be explained. Optics Letters 32, 915-917 (2007) may be helpful.

What is (v-v_g)?

Can the model be extended to CROWs e.g. IEEE Photonics Journal 2, 181-194 (2010)? This should be discussed. Backscattering also causes degradation in the time domain (see the above paper). This factor should also be discussed.

The use of a single backscatterer is reasonable but this assumption should be justified. Inteference between multiple backscattering points is possible.

Under/over coupling needs to be introduced properly. The authors appear to assume that the reader is familiar with the concept.

The sentence "... but for analysis simplicity..." shold be reworded
There is a typographic error in the acknowledgements

## Reviewer 2:

This manuscript has been written with care and is very pleasant to read. The presented model is elegant. Approximations are justified and experimental results properly fit the theoretical results. The model will be of great use for the person of the art.

Journal article titles
Capitalize only the first letter of your journal article titles, except for proper names, elements, and abbreviations.
Journal article titles should be in quotation marks, followed by a comma, like this: “Title of journal article,”
Commas following the article titles should be inside the quotation marks.
Journal titles
Correct your journal titles to the standard journal abbreviations.
Journal volumes
Volume numbers should be in bold text for articles.

There should be a comma after the volume number of your journal citations.
Remove "vol." before the volume number of your journal citations.
Remove the "no." and place issue numbers in parentheses directly after the volume number, but before the comma in your journal citations., i.e. "Opt. Express 18(6), ".
Remove "pp." before the page numbers in article references.
Books
Book titles should be in italic font.
Commas after the book title should be removed unless an edition number is included or an editor listing is provided.

[x] Main text:
When your reference callouts appear at the end of your sentences, place them inside the period. End of sentence [1]. NOT End of sentence. [1]

In-text citations—equations:
Abbreviate the single word "equation" to "Eq." and the plural word "equations" to "Eqs." throughout the text, except for when either word appears at the beginning of a sentence.

When citing multiple equations in your text, it should be formatted like this: Eqs. (1) and (2) or Eqs. (1)--(3).
